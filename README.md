# RecordStore
RecordStore is a project that allows users to manage and organise
music records while securely creating and accessing their accounts. 
The system provides a user-friendly interface for performing 
CRUD operations on this entity. Each record contains a reference to the associated artist, and each artist  
contains a reference to the label they are signed to. Users can only add records by artists that are registered in the database.
